# Demo Ideas

Ideas for demos built with Cursor and Carbon: compliant, accessible, and on-brand.

---

## High impact

- **Data table page** – Carbon `DataTable` with sortable columns, batch actions, pagination, optional row expansion. Strong a11y and a common enterprise pattern.
- **Multi-step wizard** – Signup, onboarding, or checkout using Carbon `ProgressIndicator` and `ButtonSet`. Good for flow + accessibility.
- **Dashboard layout** – Full page with UI Shell, side nav or tabs, Tiles/cards, optional chart. Proves whole-page layouts on-brand.
- **Theme switcher page** – One page where users switch Carbon themes (white, g10, g90, g100). Shows design system in action.

---

## Sliders and motion

- **Content carousel / slider** – Rotating cards or testimonials. Use Carbon motion tokens; keep keyboard and pause/play for a11y.
- **Image gallery with lightbox** – Grid of images; click opens a Carbon `ComposedModal` with prev/next and escape to close.

---

## Forms and inputs

- **Advanced form demo** – `Dropdown`, `MultiSelect`, `DatePicker`, `TimePicker`, `FileUploader`, `Slider`, conditional sections. Complements the contact form.
- **Search + filter page** – Carbon `Search` with filters (e.g. `Dropdown`, `MultiSelect`) and a results list or table.

---

## Content and structure

- **Tabs + accordion page** – Several `Tabs` with rich content and an `Accordion` section (e.g. FAQ). Highlights keyboard nav and ARIA.
- **Tree view demo** – Carbon `TreeView` for a file tree or category hierarchy. Shows keyboard (arrow keys, expand/collapse) and semantics.

---

## Feedback and states

- **Notification patterns** – Page that triggers different Carbon notifications (inline, toast) for success/error/warning and optional actions (e.g. Undo).
- **Loading and empty states** – Page using Carbon `Skeleton` components and/or empty-state copy. Shows consistent handling of loading and “no data.”

---

## Meta

- **Accessibility showcase** – One page that calls out skip links, focus order, reduced motion, and screen reader–friendly patterns. Good for stakeholders and compliance storytelling.
